# Hacker News lite

Rough and ready app that adds some features I wanted to the [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com) homepage and removes everything else. Features:

* A way of switching to ‘best’ stories.
* Better (well, larger) responsive design.
* Everything opens in a new tab.
* Dark theme, if you like.

This is just a way of consuming headlines really, it’s not optimised at all and comments just link off to HN.

Built with the official [Hacker News API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API) on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) and [Lit](https://lit.dev).
